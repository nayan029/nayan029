						The basic aim of any divorce law in the country is to explore the possibility of settlement and cohabitation between husband and wife. However, if the couple under no circumstances wants to re-work the marriage, divorce is granted and the marriage is ultimately dissolved. Keeping this in mind, laws relating to divorce are updated and amended frequently to ease the process of divorce. Here are the new laws on divorce in India-
						
						<h5 class="sa-color2 mb-4 mt-5"><b>SC says 6- Month waiting period for Divorce not mandatory</b></h5>
						The Apex Court brought significant respite for Hindu couples pursuing divorce stating that the 6-month waiting period as prescribed under Section- 13B(2) is not mandatory but discretionary, thereby, giving directions for lower courts to speed up divorce if both husband and wife agree to settle their differences including alimony, custody of child or any other pending issues between the couple. The Supreme Court stated, “If there are no chances of reunion and there are chances of fresh rehabilitation, the court should not be powerless in enabling the parties to have a better option.” The purpose of having a cooling-off period is to safeguard a hurried decision taken by the parties and they consider all the chances of reconciliation.
						
						<h5 class="sa-color2 mb-4 mt-5"><b>Provisions governing law of maintenance are:</b></h5>
						Under Section- 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act either of the spouses is entitled to get paid for the expenses of the legal proceedings under the Act.<br/>
						Under Section- 25 of the Act, the court can direct the respondent to pay maintenance in the form of monthly payment or entire sum or even a periodical sum for a time not exceeding the life of the applicant.
						<br/><br/>
						The other important provisions relating to maintenance are Sections- 18 and 19 of the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act which was amended in 2015 and Section- 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

						<h5 class="sa-color2 mb-4 mt-5"><b>“Irretrievable Breakdown Theory” of Marriage</b></h5>
						There have been many instances where couples are cohabiting but their marriage is equivalent to a separation and there is no classified law for this.<br/><br/>

						In regard to this, a Report by the Law Commission as well as the Supreme Court was directed to the Government in 2009, in order to add irretrievable breakdown of marriage as a valid ground for divorce under Section- 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act, stating wisdom lies in accepting the pragmatic reality of life and thus, must take a decision which would ultimately be conducive for the common betterment of both the spouses .<br/><br/>

						These recommendations had resulted from the case Naveen Kohli v. Neetu Kohli after the couple proved that there was no reasonable chance of getting back together after the marriage broke down.
