                  <p class="ls-1 sr-white">If you choose to submit a Free Question on .com, you will not be charged any fees; however, Free Questions may be delayed before processing. Also, any answers you receive from Lawyers to Free Questions will not involve any Lawyer-client relationship and will be publicly displayed and viewable by all Users. You cannot choose the Lawyer that’ll answer the Free Question submitted by you – this is decided by the system automatically. The Lawyer may choose NOT to answer your question with or without assigning a reason for the same. You will be intimated in such cases via email, SMS and / or phone. Our Lawyers might be unavailable at times owing to existing questions lined up with them, and we will not be accepting free questions during such times.</p>

                  <p class="ls-1 sr-white">Though listing on .com may increase the exposure and accessibility of a Lawyer, we are not an advertising portal where businesses are listed on a priority driven by any fees paid. Our search and sort functionality is purely driven by the user entered information and the built-in algorithm.</p>
